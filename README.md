# Portfolio

## These are the main projects I have worked on, showcasing my experience in web development:

### Project: Travel Agency Web Application
This is the project I am most proud of because it allowed me to gain hands-on experience in developing a **REST API using a microservices architecture** and provided me with a **strong foundation in building complex web applications with TypeScript**. As part of a **10-person development team**, I contributed to the creation of a **scalable and efficient travel agency web application**, which included both a **backend microservices infrastructure** and a **responsive front-end interface**. This project helped me deepen my understanding of **distributed systems, API design, and front-end development best practices**.

#### Key Contributions:
- Conducted **functional and non-functional requirement analysis** to ensure the system met both business and technical needs.
- Actively participated in **Agile development processes**, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, backlog grooming, and retrospectives, ensuring smooth collaboration and iterative delivery of features.
- Designed and implemented a **microservices architecture backend** using **Spring Framework**, following the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern** to optimize read and write operations.
- Developed a **React.js front-end application**, following a **components pattern**, that efficiently consumed the **REST API microservices**, ensuring a **responsive and dynamic user experience**.

#### Technologies Used:
**Java, Spring Framework, MongoDB, TypeScript, React.js, GitHub, Docker, Eureka**

### Project: Strategy Web Game
This project involved the development of an **online strategy game** where players had to identify an **“impostor”** among them. A key challenge was ensuring that the **user interface was intuitive, engaging, and accessible to all players**, providing a **seamless and interactive gaming experience**. One of the most valuable aspects of this project was the opportunity to **learn how to integrate a REST API and a web application** and successfully **deploy them on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.

#### Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a **monolithic architecture backend** using **ASP.NET Core**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern** to separate concerns and ensure maintainability.
- Developed a **REST API service** to handle **game logic, player actions, and data persistence in MSSQL**.
- Created a **website using Razor Pages**, which consumed the **REST API** to provide players with an **intuitive and interactive interface**.
- Deployed both the **API and web application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**, ensuring **high availability and scalability**.
- Ensured **cross-browser compatibility and responsive UI** by leveraging **HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript**.

#### Technologies Used:
**C#, ASP .NET Core, MSSQL, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, OCI.**
